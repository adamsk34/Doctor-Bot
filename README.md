# Doctor-Bot

This was an academic project, it was made for COMP 3190, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.

Written in prolog. This bot has a list of people in its knowledge-base and a list of
their symptoms. From the command line you can call the functions diagnose() and test()
like this: diagnose(kevin) and test(jason, CF).

The code starts with a very long comment which details my feelings about it if you are
more curious.

I have included a transcript which also exists as a comment at the end of the code
